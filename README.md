# (inofficial) SatNOGS helper

This is an (inofficial) SatNOGS helper add-on. Note that this will run on your own SatNOGS account! There are no direct API calls, just simplifications for the website.

## Verification in different tabs - auto close

* In the add-on settings enable the observations verification feature checkbox
* Open Observations in tabs
* Once you verify an observation with the keybindings, it will wait for confirmation and then close the tab
* You can configure how long it will wait after the confirmation until it closes the tab
* Tabs can be restored through the browser (independent of the add-on) if a mistake was made

## Scheduling observations

* Configure the desired observation parameters in the add-on settings (such as Satellite)
* Press the toolbar button to schedule observations
