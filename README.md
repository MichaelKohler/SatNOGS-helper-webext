(inofficial) SatNOGS mass verification helper
====

This is an (inofficial) SatNOGS helper add-on:

* Open Observations in tabs
* Start addon by clicking on the icon in the toolbar
* Once you verify an observation with the keybindings, it will wait for confirmation and then close the tab
* You can configure how long it will wait after the confirmation until it closes the tab
* Tabs can be restored through the browser (independent of the add-on) if a mistake was made
